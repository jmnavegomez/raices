# Ra√≠ces Cuadradas (Square Roots)

This folder contains various files with square root solving algorithms.
The algorithms are code from different solving methods

There are two square solving algorithms that came from an original idea based on the development of my own ideas and efforts. I'm not a mathematician so no sure if they already exists as shown. However I will share the mathematical development to show the origin of the formulas I've developed.
